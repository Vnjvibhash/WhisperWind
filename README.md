4. **Chat**: Send and receive messages in real-time
5. **Manage**: Access settings to customize app behavior and manage devices

## Architecture

The app follows clean architecture principles with:
- Separation of concerns between UI, business logic, and data layers
- Provider pattern for reactive state management
- Repository pattern for data access
- Service layer for external integrations (Bluetooth, database)

## Future Enhancements

Potential features for future development:
- File sharing over Bluetooth
- Voice message recording/playback
- Message encryption for enhanced security
- Group chat support
- Message reactions and emojis
- Offline AI chat summary generation
- Custom notification sounds
- Message search functionality

## Development Notes

- Uses custom UUID for Bluetooth service identification
- Implements Nordic UART Service (NUS) protocol for data transmission
- Local database schema supports message history and device management
- Responsive UI adapts to different screen sizes
- Material Design 3 theming with custom color schemes

## Troubleshooting

**Connection Issues:**
- Ensure both devices have Bluetooth enabled
- Make sure devices are in close proximity (within 10 meters)
- Check that location permissions are granted on Android

**Message Delivery:**
- Verify stable Bluetooth connection
- Check that the receiving device is running WhisperWind
- Restart Bluetooth connection if messages aren't sending

**Scanning Problems:**
- Ensure location services are enabled on Android
- Try refreshing the device scan
- Check Bluetooth adapter compatibility
